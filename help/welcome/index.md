The goal of this project is to offer a narrative based education of tea, from it's humble beginnings as bitter medicine, to it's lofty status in religion, empire, free trade, and war. This is a complex subject, [feel free to help out](/help-out) with donations of either time or money.

## What is Tea?

Tea refers both to a beverage form factor and "the tea plant", Camellia Sinensis, which is the most important beverage in the class. Unless qualified, as in "Herbal Tea", "Barley Tea", or similar - when I use the word tea I will always refer to tea made from the tea plant - Camellia Sinensis.  

Only considering "pure tea", from camellia sinensis, there are still many complexities which confuse many people. Green, Red, Black, Wulong (Oolong), Pu'er, and other types of tea all come from the one and only tea plant - Camellia Sinensis. 

Different styles of pure tea require different techniques to be brewed correctly - and each style presents complexity which can be accentuated by the "tea art master" who prepares the beverage.

## Where do we start?

Every story has a beginning, and the beginnings of Teastory (a portmanteau of tea and history) have been told countless times in countless ways, and of course we will cover that... 
The advantages to a chronological approach to history makes up for in simplicity what they lack in flavor, but truthfully, a cup of tea is as deeper than an ocean of words -> and the first teas were drank up a long time ago.

Our story will be enjoyed a cup at a time, and our sense of history will be based in our experience of our senses - enriched sometimes with cream - and sometimes with imaginings from times long past excerpted from seas of contemporary and historical literature.

## How to use this project?

Each article will feature one or more specific teas from a reputable American distributer. Relevant information about the possibility of variations under the same name will be addressed in the article in case the tea is no longer available or you are buying in a different market.

_The full setup instructions for following along with this tutorial style guide are written in "[Setup](./articles/setup)"._

## Do I need to buy expensive tea and equipment to participate?

Yes, and No. You will not benefit as much from reading an article about Jin Jun Mei if you can not afford to buy the tea, or even several examples of the tea, but our [tea on a budget](./articles/tea-on-a-budget) segment is a great read if you want to optimize your tea experience on a dollar per sip basis.
