I'd like to help you go through a few Chinese tea terms. It seems that the obvious place to start in this series will be the 六大茶类 (liu da cha lei; 6 big tea types). The list is organized according to how oxidized (发酵; fa jiao; fermentation) the tea is. The terminology was developed before the discovery of oxygen, but we now know that 'fermentation' is a misnomer.

It's a lot to remember, so I'll be doing this in short segments, but here we go! 

绿茶 (lu cha; green tea)
These teas are less than 5% oxidized. They are fixed (杀青; sha qing), and dried (干燥; gan zao). Sometimes they are rolled (揉捻; rou nian) and withered (凋萎; diao wei).

黄茶 (huang cha; yellow tea)
10-20% oxidation. Similar to green tea except in that it is heaped (渥堆; wo dui) after being fixed (杀青; sha qing) and before drying (ganzao; 干燥). So, it is 杀青, 凋萎 (or not), 渥堆, and 干燥. 

白茶 (bai cha; white tea)
Between 20-30% oxidation. The simplest of processing, only withering (凋萎; diao wei) and drying (干燥;  gan zao).

乌龙 (wulong; black dragon). Also called 清茶 (qing cha; blue-green tea).
Mostly between 30-65% oxidized, but baozhong is only 18%. The most complicated process. A rolling (揉捻; rou nian) process is added and repeated in after allowing the tea to oxidize (发酵; fa jiao). The steps are: 凋萎, 揉捻, 发酵, 杀青, 干燥.

红茶 (hong cha; red tea; aka. “black tea”)
Over 80% oxidized. To make black tea first 凋萎, 揉捻 or 揉切 (rou qie; kneed cut),  oxidation (fa jiao; 发酵), and then dried(gan zao; 干燥). Similar to wulong but more straightforward in that it's only going through each process once.  

黑茶 (hei cha; black tea)
Also over 80% oxidized. These are very often aged or post-processed (再加工; zai jia gong) to bring the oxidation level nearer and nearer to 100%. The steps are: 杀青, 揉捻, 渥堆, 干燥, 再加工.

Feedback? Way too much info? This is super simplified, but correct enough.




绿茶 (lu cha; green tea)
Green tea is the oldest type of tea. The oxidation can be fixed (杀青; kill green) by 蒸青 (zheng qing; steam green), 炒青 (chao qing; fry green), 晒青 (shai qing; sun green), and 烘青?? (hong qing; bake green). All green tea is classified according to this processing. Dragon Well (龙井; long jing) gets it's characteristic flat shape from being hand pressed against a giant wok making it a 炒青绿茶 (chaoqing lucha). Green Pu'er (生普洱; sheng pu'er; raw pu'er) on the other hand is a 晒青绿茶 (shaiqing lucha). Less popular in the west, but still world famous, are 玉露 (yu lu; jade dew) a 蒸青绿茶 (zhengqing lucha) which is the ancestor of the now more famous Japanese Gyokuro??, and 黄山毛峰 (huang shan mao feng; yellow mountain fur peak) a 烘青绿茶 (hongqing lucha??).

Historically speaking, before the development of 绿茶 (lucha) as we know it today there was 龙凤团茶 (long feng tuan cha; dragon phoenix lump tea). The tea was the made for the imperial court of the Northern Song Dynasty and was decorated with a dragon phoenix motif (from which it's name comes).




红茶 (hong cha; red tea; “black tea”)
Chronologically speaking the second type of tea is 红茶 (hong cha). It was first invented by accident when a farmer from 桐木关 (tong mu guan) near 武夷山 (Wuyi Shan) in 福建 (Fujian) allowed his tea to oxidize as he was busy hiding some soldiers from an enemy army. Returning to his would be green tea and finding it ruined by time he hoped to recoup some of his losses by quickly drying it over a pine brush fire. The tea sold well enough that he continued to improve upon the method to create the first 正山小种 (zheng shan xiao zhong; proper mountain small variety). You may know of this tea as lapang souchang which seems to be a Dutch bastardization of an earlier name spoken in the local dialect. Don't listen to people who say that black tea from 拉普山 (la pu shan; lapu mountain) is called 拉普山小种 (la pu shan xiao zhong; lapu mountain small variety); there is no such lapu mountain, and the name in Chinese is only in order that Chinese tea merchants can understand foreigners who are looking to buy “lapsang souchang”.

小种茶 (xiao zhong cha; small variety tea) is made by 

The next big revolution in red tea happened a bit north in 祁门 (qi men). Post processing methods became more refined and because of the extra time and effort required the new tea was called 工夫红 (gong fu hong; time/effort red). 

The third major development is called 碎茶 (sui cha; broken tea). This  actually happened in 印度 (yin du; India), and I am not clear on all of the historical details. While it may come as a surprise to you (and most Chinese tea drinkers), but China does produce some of the worlds finest 碎茶 (sui cha). All 碎茶 is meticulously graded as either 叶茶 (ye cha; leaf tea); 片茶 (pian cha; flake tea), 碎茶 (sui cha; broken tea), or 抹茶 (mo cha; smear tea??).
